## Assignment: Developing a Golang gRPC User Service with Search

<details> 
<summary> OBJECTIVES </summary>

1. Your task in this assessment is to create a Golang gRPC service that provides specific functionalities for managing user details and includes a search capability. The primary objectives are as follows:
2. Simulate a database by maintaining a list of user details within a variable.
3. Create gRPC endpoints for fetching user details based on a user ID and retrieving a list of 
   user details based on a list of user IDs.
4. Implement a search functionality to find user details based on specific criteria.

### Sample User Model:

{"id": 1, "fname": "Steve", "city": "LA", "phone": 1234567890, "height": 5.8, "Married": true}



### Maintain Code Quality and Design: 
1. Ensure that the code is well-structured and follows best practices.
2. Apply suitable design patterns to enhance the maintainability and extensibility of your service.



### Develop and Test APIs:
1. Implement the specified gRPC service methods to accomplish the tasks.
2. Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of your APIs.



### Input Validation and Response Handling:
1. Validate incoming requests to ensure they adhere to the defined requirements.
2. Handle requests appropriately and respond with meaningful messages, especially in the case of errors.



### Implement Search Functionality:
1. Create a search endpoint that allows users to search for specific user details based on criteria (e.g., city, phone number, marital status, etc.).



### Cover Edge Cases:
1. Identify potential edge cases and consider these in your implementation to provide robust and reliable functionality.



### Extra Brownie Points:
1. Use design patterns creatively to improve your service's architecture and efficiency.
2. Containerize the entire application using Docker for easy deployment and scaling.



### Mode of Submission:
Create a private GitHub repository for your project.
Include a README.md file in your repository with detailed instructions on how to:
   1. Build and run the application.
   2. Access the gRPC service endpoints.
   3. Provide any necessary configuration details.
 Share the link to your GitHub repository, and if necessary, provide a ZIP archive or a Google Drive link for submission.
